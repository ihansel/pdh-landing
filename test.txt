## Background & Rationale for the Hub

**For questions about:**
- Why the hub exists
- why the hub does what it does
- why council invested in the hub
- why digital focus

The Hub is an initiative of the Noosa Council - it is wholly owned and operated by the Council. The idea of developing the digital sector was conceived in the wake of Local Economic strategy review by Council in 2013 that identified an over-reliance on the tourism and hospitality sectors, and the catastrophic economic disruptions caused by uncontrollables like major weather events, natural disasters, global pandemics, etc. It also recognised that Noosa has finite carrying capacity for tourists and visitors and that other sectors needed to be developed in order to grow the economy and ensure the continued prosperity of the Noosa community. It also identified the problem of a youth brain drain from the region and the need for more attractive employment options to help retain young people in the region. Around the same time, a small digital sector had started to form organically in the region. A company called Atmail, a cloud email provider, had established itself in a small office space in Peregian Beach and there was a nascent community of digital professionals and consultants working remotely via the rapidly improving broadband in the region. The first digital sector networks started to form at this time, with the creation of the Silicon Coast and Coding from Beach meetup groups. Members of this community organised a TEDx event in Noosa in 2013 and a key theme of the event was technology and innovation. These activities heavily influenced Council's decision to add the Digital sector to the economic development mix, recognising it as a high value employment sectors with a small environmental footprint, that could be nurtured to boost Noosa's economic resilience.

## History of the Peregian Digital Hub

**For questions about:**
- How the Hub came about
- backstory of the hub

In 2013 the Peregian Beach Bowls Club went into receivership, unable to sustain itself financially. Council acquired the land, partly to stave off community concerns about the development of a shopping centre on the site. Following community consultation, Council decided to create a knowledge campus on one third of the site and maintain the rest as green space for the community. Through the lobbying efforts of the nascent digital community, especially those of Ben Duncan (founder of Atmail), Council developed a plan to create a digital hub on the site. The Hub was built at a cost of $4.39 million funded through ratepayer funds and a grant from the state government. Construction was completed in early 2018 and the Hub commenced operations on 7 July 2018 with Atmail as an anchor tenant. It is now January 2023 and the Hub has been operating successfully for 5 and and a half years. The catastrophic bushfires of 2019 almost burnt down the Hub and the entire Peregian Beach township, saved only by the brave efforts of over 300 volunteer firefighters. The Hub was able to operate through much of the Covid pandemic, save for a 4 week period early in the pandemic where it was forced to close due to State government rules. Council was awarded grants from the federal bushfire recovery fund and that funding allowed for the development of the Hub's second stage, the newly opened AI Lab.

## The Mandate of the Peregian Digital Hub

**For questions about:**
- fit with hub criteria
- why the focus on tech
- am i a fit
- who is the hub for
- do i qualify

<Note: this section pertains to membership of the Hub and is useful for dealing with membership enquiries>. The Hub facility itself has a usable office/work space of 600m2 and thus can only accommodate a maximum of 110 people working at desks any one time. Memberships and leases at the Hub are therefore a limited resource. Our mandate is to allocate those memberships and leases to companies and individuals that, based on our professional judgment and industry expertise, have the best prospects of building (or contributing to) high growth tech ventures that have the propensity to create jobs and contribute to gross regional product. These tend to be software as a service startups and digital/tech specialists who work remotely for tech companies but have the knowledge and skills to contribute to the success of others building companies at the Hub. This curation is done via an application process. Interested parties can apply for membership at the Hub by completing an application form. This gathers information about them and their business to help Hub/Council staff assess whether there is a sector fit, a fit with the Hub's cultural objectives, and the business growth potential to meet the sector growth objectives of Council

A futuristic Digital Hub and AI Lab located in a beautiful beachside village in Queensland, is a rather unusual phenomenon and it has attracted an unusually talented cohort of startup founders, technologists and digital specialists who call it their home away from home. Many of these folks moved to the Coast in recent years to access the incredible lifestyle on offer, without trading off their ambition to do great work or build high growth startups.
